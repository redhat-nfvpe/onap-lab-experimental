# Inventory of infrastructure nodes, which can include both physical and virtual machines.
#
# Used by "openstack overcloud node import".
#
# Custom format. See:
#   https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/baremetal.html#instackenv
#
# Note: This file is often named "instackenv" and is sometimes in JSON rather than YAML.
#
# Profiles
# --------
#
# Note that the "name" property here is optional and descriptive ("openstack baremetal node list")
# and does *not* specify the type of the infrastructure node. 
#
# Instead, the "profile" tag in "capabilities" can be used to make an infrastructure node assignable
# to specific OpenStack roles. See "openstack/nodes.yaml". To assign multiple profile tags to a node
# you must use a different syntax, e.g.:
#
#   capabilities: control_profile:1,compute_profile:1
#
# (The "1" is just a placeholder value for the tag.)
#
# Virtual machines
# ----------------
#
# TripleO uses Ironic to manage *all* infrastructure nodes, both physical and virtual machines.
# It does not support libvirt directly. To allow it to manage our virtual machines we've installed
# VirtualBMC on the Manager to provide IPMI on a single IP address. Each virtual machine gets
# its own assigned port on that IP address.
#
# Ceph
# ----
#
# For nodes intended for Ceph (ComputeHCI) see "../ceph.yaml" for disk arrangement and
# configuration.
#
# Physical machines without IMPI
# ------------------------------
#
# No IPMI? No problem! Use "pm_type: manual-management" and remove other "pm_" properties. You will
# need to keep track of the node state (via "watch openstack baremetal node list") and turn the
# power on and off yourself when directed.
#
# UEFI
# ----
#
# UEFI could be tricky. If your machine *only* supports UEFI then introspection would detect this
# and then the operating system would be deployed in UEFI mode. However, many machines use UEFI but
# for network boot (PXE) only support BIOS mode (via CSM). This means that introspection would
# detect them as BIOS instead of UEFI and the operating system would be installed in BIOS mode. It
# would then fail to boot from disk. If this is your situation (UEFI with BIOS-only network boot)
# then you should set your machine to use BIOS/CSM *only*.
#

#   https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/uefi_boot.html
#
# Overriding
# ----------
#
# By default the maximum resources reported by introspection will be available for provisioning.
# It's possible to override these limits as well as other introspection data here, e.g.:
#
#  cpu: 18
#  memory: 244141 # MiB
#  disk: 1000 # GiB
#  arch: x86_64
