# Neutron configuration.
#
# This is a Heat template environment.
#
# Neutron is installed on the controller node with its ML2 plugin, which is in turn configured to
# use the OVN agent. (OpenStack versions before "stein" used the OVS agent.)
#
# Many of these values will be set in
# "/var/lib/config-data/neutron/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini".
#
# See: https://docs.openstack.org/heat/stein/template_guide/environment.html

parameter_defaults:

  # OVN "flat" network names
  NeutronFlatNetworks: datacentre,public

  # OVN "vlan" network names
  # Note that "datacentre" can also be used a flat network, as defined above (untagged, or VLAN=1)
  NeutronNetworkVLANRanges: datacentre:1:1000

  # Maps OVN network names to OVS bridges (via "ovn::controller::ovn_bridge_mappings")
  # See: "sudo ovs-vsctl get open . external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings"
  NeutronBridgeMappings: datacentre:br-ex,public:br-public

  # List of network types (will be used in order)
  NeutronNetworkType: geneve,vlan

  # Customize bonding options
  BondInterfaceOvsOptions: bond_mode=active-backup

  # Define the DNS servers (maximum 2)
  # When the list is not set or empty the nameservers on the ctlplane subnets will be used
  # (ctlplane subnets nameservers are controlled by "undercloud_nameservers" option in "undercloud.conf")
  DnsServers: []
