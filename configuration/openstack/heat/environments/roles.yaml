# Infrastructure node requests per each role.
#
# This is a Heat template environment.
#
# Infrastructure nodes are assigned to roles via an algorithm that iterates available
# infrastructure nodes and checks if they meet the requirements for the role. The requirements are
# specified via the "flavor".
#
# Flavors must be one of the options from "openstack flavor list". Each flavor specifies minimum
# hardware capabilities for an infrastructure node, but can also specify a required "profile" tag.
# If the infrastructure node does not have that profile tag then it will not match. If it has
# multiple profile tags and one of them matches then the algorithm will assign the role, and *also*
# set the "current profile" for the infrastructure node to the matched profile.
#
# For convenience, the default flavors are preconfigured to require a profile tag of the same name,
# e.g. flavor "compute" requires the profile tag "compute". The exception is flavor "baremetal"
# (the default), which doesn't require any profile tag. Specifying that flavor for a role here means
# that any infrastructure node (that meets the minimum hardware capabilities) could be matched.
#
# Thus, if you want an infrastructure node to be assignable to only one role, then you must 1) give
# it a profile tag, 2) make sure there's a flavor that requires that tag, and 3) select that flavor
# for the role here.
#
# See all current profile assignments with "openstack overcloud profiles list".
#
# Note that some roles come with a "CountDefault". Keep that in mind in case you see some roles
# requesting infrastructure nodes even if you didn't do so explicitly here. For example,
# "Controller" has "CountDefault: 1". If you don't want any controllers then override it:
# "ControllerCount: 0".
