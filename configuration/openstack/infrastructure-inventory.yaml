# Specify your inventory of infrastructure nodes, which can include both physical and virtual
# machines.

# Used by "openstack overcloud node import".

# Note: This file is often named "instackenv" and is sometimes in JSON rather than YAML.
# See: https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/baremetal.html#instackenv

# Profiles
# --------

# The "profile" tag in "capabilities" can be used to make an infrastructure node assignable to
# specific OpenStack roles. See "openstack/nodes.yaml". To assign multiple profile tags to a node
# you must use a different syntax, e.g.:
#
#   capabilities: control_profile:1,compute_profile:1
#
# (The "1" is just a placeholder value for the tag.)

# Virtual machines
# ----------------

# TripleO uses Ironic to manage *all* infrastructure nodes, both physical and virtual machines.
# It does not support libvirt directly. To allow it to manage our virtual machines we've installed
# VirtualBMC on the Manager to provide IPMI on a single IP address. Each virtual machine gets
# its own assigned port on that IP address.

# Physical machines without IMPI
# ------------------------------

# No IPMI? No problem! Use "pm_type: manual-management", keep track of the node state (via
# "watch openstack baremetal node list") and turn the power on and off yourself.

# UEFI
# ----

# UEFI could be tricky. If your machine *only* supports UEFI then introspection would detect this
# and then the operating system would be deployed in UEFI mode. However, many machines use UEFI but
# for network boot (PXE) only support BIOS mode (via CSM). This means that introspection would
# detect them as BIOS instead of UEFI and the operating system would be installed in BIOS mode. It
# would then fail to boot from disk. If this is your situation (UEFI with BIOS-only network boot)
# then you should set your machine to use BIOS *only*.

# TODO
# For UEFI machines make sure to add "boot_mode:uefi" to capabilities, otherwise they will fail
# to boot after provisioned:
# https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/uefi_boot.html

# Overriding introspection:

# By default the maximum resources reported by introspection will be available for provisioning.
# It's possible to override these limits as well as other introspection data here:
#
#  cpu: 6
#  memory: 4096 # MiB
#  disk: 100 # GiB
#  arch: x86_64
