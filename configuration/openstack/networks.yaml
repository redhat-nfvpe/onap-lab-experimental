# Infrastructure networks.
#
# This is a custom format ingested by "network-environment.j2.yaml" and "network-isolation.j2.yaml"
# to generate Heat template environments. 
#
# This file was modified from the default at:
#   /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/network_data.yaml
#
# Our addition is a Public network that has two intended uses:
#
# 1) Allows the undercloud nodes access to the outside world. This is necessary during overcloud
#    deployment in order to download packages and container images from the Internet.
#
# 2) Can be used as a floating IP provider network for the overcloud, to allow workloads to be
#    accessed by the outside world. To achieve this the Neutron ML2 plugin must be configured
#    to map a "flat" OVN network name to a bridge.
#
# See: https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/custom_networks.html
