OpenStack control plane.

Used by OpenStack manager (TripleO) to control and provision OpenStack nodes.

For this to work, you need to configure bridge "br-os-ctl" on the Manager.

There are two main ways to configure this bridge:

1) Dedicated LAN for the OpenStack control plane. In this case all OpenStack nodes will be on this
   LAN. Your Manager will also need a dedicated NIC on this LAN, and it should be added to the
   bridge.

2) Single LAN. This is a more complicated scenario. In this case your Manager just needs a single
   NIC. However, you will also need to configure your router. First you will need to IP route
   192.168.24.0/24 to your Manager IP address. This will allow the OpenStack nodes to access the
   OpenStack manager. Then you'll need to configure your router's DHCP server to forward PXE
   requests to 192.168.24.1, which is the OpenStack manager's TFTP server.

Note that virtual machines that need to PXE-boot from this network will need it connected as the
first network, eth0, because libvirt's PXE only works on eth0.
