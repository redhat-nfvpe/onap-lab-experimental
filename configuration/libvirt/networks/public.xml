<!--
Public network.

Used for Neutron's floating IPs in OpenStack.

The OpenStack controller node will be bridging to its interface on this network using OVS, and that
bridge will be mapped to an OVN "flat" network, which in turn will be used by Neturon's ML2 plugin
and defined as a provider network. 

We are deliberately not enabling DHCP on this network: instead, we will use fixed addresses and keep
track of them manually. For example, 10.0.2.2 will be used by the controller. See:
"../../openstack/node-networking.j2.yaml".
