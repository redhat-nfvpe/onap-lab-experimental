# The default container image tag is "current-tripleo-rdo", which can break our deployment because
# 1) it is updated often and can introduce breaking changes to these scripts, and 2) it is not set
# simultaneously on all container images, so that if we download images *while* it is being set
# (which is often) then we would be getting images of different versions, which may very well be
# incompatible and lead to failed deployments. It is thus best to use a specific ID tag that has
# been tested and known to work. While experimenting with tags beware of "error pulling image" in
# the logs, indicating that some images of our tag may not have been uploaded yet.
